# IEEE SRM SB R&D Domain Recruitment Tasks
Hello! 
myself Aashi and these are all the tasks. 


## Section 1
I have attached the word as well as the pdf file containing the answers of all the mcqs and questions asked with output.
## Section 2

I have attached the .py file for this section. 

Here are the other necessary details: 

### Problem Statement : 

Implement a Linear Regression model from scratch without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. 

### Instructions on how to run the code:

ensure you have Python installed by checking the version with python --version. 

Install the NumPy library, by running pip install numpy in the terminal.

Copy the provided code into a text editor and save it as a .py

Then run the program.

### A brief description of your approach. 


The approach implemented in the code uses simple linear regression to model the relationship between years of experience and salary. The algorithm uses a method called gradient descent, which gradually adjusts the slope and intercept of a line to make the predictions as close as possible to the actual values. First, the program asks the user to enter the number of years of experience and salary for each employee. Then, it trains the model with this data by repeatedly improving the slope and intercept based on how far off the predictions are. Once the training is done, the program can predict salaries for the provided experience values and also lets the user enter new experience levels to predict future salaries.





## Section 3

Task 1: I have attached the jpeg as well as the pdf of the poster. 
Task 2: I have attached the word as well as the pdf of the summary of the research paper, i chose "the perceptron" as my topic. the files are named the same.
